# Escape Velocity: An Economic Game Powered by Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption Technology üöÄ

Escape Velocity is an innovative GameFi platform designed to challenge players in a unique economic simulation where the ultimate goal is to accumulate wealth while surpassing an ever-growing "escape velocity" threshold. This complex gameplay experience is made possible by **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology**, ensuring that player wealth accumulation remains confidential and securely managed throughout the game.

## The Challenge of Modern Economic Games üéÆ

In traditional economic games, transparency often compromises the player's experience and security. Players face the risk of their strategies and accumulated wealth being exposed to competitors, leading to imbalances in gameplay. Moreover, as economic systems evolve, the disparity in wealth accumulation can mirror real-world class structures, making it hard for new players to compete fairly. How do you create a game that simulates these challenges while maintaining fairness and confidentiality?

## The FHE Advantage: A New Frontier in Gaming üîí

By leveraging **Zama's open-source FHE libraries**, specifically the **Concrete** and **TFHE-rs**, Escape Velocity enables a seamless gaming experience where player data remains encrypted. The escape velocity threshold, a dynamically increasing wealth barrier, is managed using FHE, meaning it's both confidential and challenging to surpass. This intrinsic security creates a competitive yet fair environment, allowing players to strategize without the fear of vulnerability. 

Using Zama's FHE technology, we can simulate real-world economic dynamics and class barriers while providing a secure and private environment for players to compete. This revolutionary approach empowers our platform to provide a social experiment that explores the dynamics of wealth accumulation and its societal implications.

## Core Functionalities üåü

- **Dynamic Escape Velocity Threshold**: The threshold for victory is not static; it grows over time, ensuring that players must continually strategize to stay ahead.
- **Confidential Wealth Accumulation**: Players' wealth status is encrypted, keeping their strategies and successes confidential from competitors.
- **Social Experimentation**: The game serves as a case study of economic classes and the challenges of rising through them, stimulating discussions about wealth disparity.
- **Engaging Interface**: A visually abstract representation of wealth growth and threshold challenges enhances player immersion.

## Technology Stack üõ†Ô∏è

Our technology stack is designed to ensure robust performance and security:

- **Zama Fully Homomorphic Encryption SDK**: Core technology for secure and confidential computations.
- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime for building and running the application.
- **Hardhat/Foundry**: Development environment for smart contract compilation, testing, and deployment.
- **Solidity**: Smart contract programming language for Ethereum-based applications.

## Installation Instructions üöÄ

To set up the Escape Velocity project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have **Node.js** installed on your development machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory you have downloaded (do **not** use `git clone`).
3. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies, including Zama's FHE libraries:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Building and Running the Project üèóÔ∏è

After successful installation, you can compile and run the project using the following commands:

1. **Compile the Smart Contracts**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Run Tests**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Deploy the Contracts**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
   ```

4. **Start the Development Server** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Example Code Snippet üí°

Here‚Äôs a simple illustration of how you might implement the core mechanics of the dynamic escape velocity threshold in the smart contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract escapeVelocityGameFHE {
    mapping(address => uint256) private wealth;
    uint256 public escapeVelocity;

    constructor() {
        escapeVelocity = 100; // Initial escape velocity threshold
    }

    function accumulateWealth(uint256 amount) public {
        wealth[msg.sender] += amount;
        if (wealth[msg.sender] > escapeVelocity) {
            // Implement winning logic
        }
    }

    function increaseEscapeVelocity(uint256 increment) internal {
        escapeVelocity += increment; // Dynamic growth of escape velocity
    }
}
```
